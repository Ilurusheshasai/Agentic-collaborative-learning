Feedback from the review:

Write:
1) A concise, encouraging **email subject** about their linear regression notes - keep it short and engaging.
2) A warm, motivating **email body** that:
   - Greets them by first name
   - References the CS101 course and week 3
   - Gives specific, constructive feedback on their linear regression notes
   - If NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT: Mentions they should add practical applications and simple case studies
   - If APPROVED: Congratulates them with positive, specific feedback
   - Encourages them to check out the Drive link with resources
   - Mentions this topic will be discussed further in the next class
   - Uses a professional but friendly tone
   - Includes appropriate emoji(s) (1-2 total)
   - Closes with an encouraging line and a signature

The body should be formatted as plain text with **bold** and *italics* where appropriate.
Make sure the email is motivating, helpful, and specific to linear regression concepts.

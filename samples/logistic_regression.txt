Logistic Regression
===================

1. Definition and Theoretical Background
----------------------------------------
Logistic regression is a statistical method for modeling the probability of a binary outcome (0 or 1) as a function of one or more predictor variables. Unlike linear regression, which predicts a continuous output, logistic regression uses the logistic (sigmoid) function to squeeze predicted values into the [0, 1] interval, making them interpretable as probabilities. The model assumes the log‑odds (logit) of the probability is a linear combination of the inputs.

2. Mathematical Derivations and Formulas
----------------------------------------
For a single feature x, the model is:
  
\[
p(y=1 \mid x) = \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}},\quad z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x.
\]

Taking the logit transform:
  
\[
\mathrm{logit}(p) = \ln\!\biggl(\frac{p}{1-p}\biggr) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x.
\]

We fit parameters \(\beta\) by maximizing the likelihood:

\[
\mathcal{L}(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{y_i} (1-p_i)^{1-y_i},\quad
\ell(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \bigl[y_i \ln p_i + (1 - y_i)\ln(1-p_i)\bigr].
\]

Gradient ascent (or using scipy’s `optimize`) is used to find the maximum-likelihood estimate.

3. Simple Example
-----------------
Suppose you want to predict whether an email is spam (1) or not (0) based on its length x.  
Given data:

| x (length) | y (spam) |
|------------|----------|
|    50      |    0     |
|   500      |    1     |
|   200      |    0     |
|   800      |    1     |

Fitting a logistic model might give \(\beta_0=-4,\ \beta_1=0.01\).  
For a new email of length 400:

\[
z = -4 + 0.01 \times 400 = 0; \quad p = \sigma(0)=0.5.
\]

So there’s a 50% chance it’s spam.

4. Practical Applications and Simple Case Studies
-------------------------------------------------
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Predicting disease presence (e.g., diabetes) from risk factors (age, BMI). Case study: A 2020 study used logistic regression on 10,000 patient records to achieve 85% accuracy in diabetes prediction, guiding early interventions.  
- **Credit Scoring**: Estimating likelihood of loan default based on income, credit history. Banks routinely deploy logistic models to set interest rates and approval thresholds.  
- **Marketing**: Predicting whether a customer will respond to a campaign. A retail chain saw a 20% uplift in click‑through rate by targeting customers with high logistic‐predicted response probability.
